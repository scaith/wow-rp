# wow-rp

Provides a structured way to create, store, and maintain game, character, and other information for my World of Warcraft experience. It is split into three sections: 1) character info, 2) macros, and 3) guides.

## Character Info (char-info)
A directory that provides an overview of all my World of Warcraft (WoW) characters in an over-arching file, and then breaks them down by alligence (alliance / horde). All are to be assumed to exist within the CC/SoE retail realm, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

For each character, a shory synopsis of each character is to be provided as a list for each faction in a summary directory markdown file. This should include enough information to introduce / refresh a person about the character and where their story-progression currently is. It is designed to be shared publically, and should be limited to 100 words or less.

Each character's information are broken up into the following files:

- **Markdown Profile** (PUBLIC): The primary file containing the most up-to-date main information on a character. It is meant to be readable by other players as a detailed summary and overview of the character.
- **TRP3 Profile** (PUBLIC): The main profile used by the TRP3 WoW Add-On, and is meant to display a character's information as both a quick reference and a detailed outline of the character, their RP hooks, abilities, etc. Any changes to this file must be first completed and finalized in the Markdown Profile, then ported over to this file afterwards.
- **RP Diary** (PRIVATE): A markdown file that contains review notes of RP sessions that have been made between this character and others. This is to help reference actions taken in the past that may affect current / future sessions.
- **Event Notes** (Private): Another markdown file containing review notes of events that the character has been involved in that may shape and/or alter the course of their development. This includes both events with other players, or even events / activities done alone that might also affect the character.

## Guides
Files and print-outs containing valuable guide information for WoW Retail / Classic gameplay and mechanics. This would include leveling guides, gold farming advice, and character setup tips.

## Macros
Contains all my macros that I use, and for what profiles / characters. This is so that in the event of any of my macros within the game get corrupted / lost, I can have a backup here. It also serves as the center of development for all my in-game macros.
