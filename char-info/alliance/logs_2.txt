22:06:55 Edna Mullby says: Are you having a good time during Brewfest, hunter?
22:07:15 Donna says: I have your gorilla! Nyah nyah!
22:07:15 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:07:37 Donna says: I wonder if your Grindgear Gorilla can jump across the Park!
22:07:37 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:09:50 Gil says: I wanna see the Mage Tower.
22:10:00 Edna Mullby says: Are you having a good time during Brewfest, hunter?
22:10:06 Gil says: I wanna see the Mage Tower.
22:10:24 Donna says: Now who's the crybaby, crybaby!?
22:10:24 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:10:48 Donna says: Whoops!
22:10:48 William says: Gimmie back Jum-jump!
22:13:06 Edna Mullby says: Are you having a good time during Brewfest, hunter?
22:13:56 Donna says: I have your gorilla! Nyah nyah!
22:13:56 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:15:21 Thomas Miller says: Freshly baked bread for sale!
22:16:12 Edna Mullby says: Welcome!
22:16:42 Donna says: I wonder how far the gears turn?
22:16:42 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:16:47 Donna says: Ha ha! I have your Grindgear Gorilla!
22:16:47 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:17:09 Donna says: I wonder if your Grindgear Gorilla can jump across the Park!
22:17:09 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:18:13 Thomas Miller says: Fresh bread for sale!
22:19:19 Edna Mullby says: Greetings, hunter.
22:19:24 Thomas Miller says: Freshly baked bread for sale!
22:19:54 Donna says: Now who's the crybaby, crybaby!?
22:19:54 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:20:18 Donna says: Ha ha! I have your Grindgear Gorilla!
22:20:18 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:20:52 Adlanna-SistersofElune notices the casting of several spells around her from the mysterious character. She blinks up briefly from her map
22:21:44 Adlanna-SistersofElune feels surprisingly better from something they did, She closes her map and decides to check on something in the inn
22:23:34 Donna says: Ha ha! I have your Grindgear Gorilla!
22:23:34 William says: WAAAHHH!!!
22:24:37 Gil says: Are we there yet?
22:25:29 Thomas Miller says: Warm, wholesome bread!
22:26:19 Human Commoner says: Here's to the Alliance!
22:26:48 Donna says: Ha ha! I have your Grindgear Gorilla!
22:26:48 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:31:19 Human Commoner says: Here's to the Alliance!
22:33:06 Donna says: I have your gorilla! Nyah nyah!
22:33:06 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:36:47 Eloise-CenarionCircle waves at Innkeeper Allison.
22:37:23 Adlanna-SistersofElune walks down the stairs of the inn with her small tabby in arms
22:37:39 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks over the bookcase.
22:38:01 Adlanna-SistersofElune pauses in slight disbelief at the top of the final flight to see a familiar face
22:38:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hello, Eloise!
22:38:25 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
22:38:31 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Ah! Why hello there.
22:38:49 Adlanna-SistersofElune sports a reserved grin as she approaches while petting her cat
22:39:00 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: It is... unexpected yet nice to see you here.
22:39:04 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Aww! Who's this?
22:39:12 Eloise-CenarionCircle offers the cat her hand for sniffing.
22:40:07 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks down in fondness ah she watches the little rascal sniff the extended limb before meowing
22:40:30 Eloise-CenarionCircle tries giving behind-the-ear scritchies.
22:40:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: This is a little one I found a few days back. Have to have Allison here watch the scoundrel from time to time when I have to leave.
22:41:26 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: A stray? There seems to be no shortage of them....
22:41:34 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles as the little cat decides to acquiesce to the affection and leans into it
22:42:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Yes... unfortunately if his cuteness wasn't enough, my other larger cat seems to view him as one of her own
22:42:40 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well....as long as you don't have...I don't know....thirty cats, you are probably safe from being a crazy old cat lady.
22:43:05 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ... I better not tell you how I found him from then...
22:43:13 Eloise-CenarionCircle chuckles.
22:43:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: What brings you here? Have you been renting a room?
22:44:32 [Adlanna-SistersofEl0une]: Yes, actually. Was staying her getting aclimated to the "normal life" of people around
22:44:39 Eloise-CenarionCircle nods at you.
22:44:55 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: A good place for it. It's a nice little inn, if a bit busy at times.
22:45:20 Eloise-CenarionCircle gestures to the bookshelf. "Sometimes I pop in to do a little light reading."
22:46:50 Adlanna-SistersofElune tilts her head curiously "... I find that a refreshing point of you. To be honest, I haven't had time to spend on such."
22:47:33 Adlanna-SistersofElune pauses in thought before remembering something important
22:48:03 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I have to read -something- besides magical treatises sometimes. But now that I've run into you, well, I'd -much- rather do a bit of socializing.
22:48:35 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I would agree. By the way... I just remembered something I wanted to ask you about the next time we spoke face-to-face
22:48:59 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh, what's that?
22:49:31 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I heard at a gathering at Booty Bay when I was there that you are well known for your... tailoring?  I am sorry for asking, but was curious if you might be able to help me make something more...
22:49:49 Eloise-CenarionCircle gets a very bright smile!
22:50:38 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes slightly in embarrasement "I-I do not tell much, but my love of fashion has... sprung up again since coming back around people. I have tried keeping myself presentable while on the road myself with my own wares, but... I am not that skilled."
22:51:01 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((tell many*))
22:51:15 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If someone claims to be a seamstress and gets -upset- at being asked to help someone accessorize, then they aren't a very good tailor at all, in -my- opinion. I'd love to help!
22:52:12 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks relieved at hearing that

22:17:09 William says: No fair!  Gimme back my gorilla!!
22:18:13 Thomas Miller says: Fresh bread for sale!
22:19:19 Edna Mullby says: Greetings, hunter.

22:52:12 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks relieved at hearing that
22:52:22 Eloise-CenarionCircle eyes the elf up and down.
22:52:49 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: What were you thinking? A dress? Tunic? Tunic and some breeches?
22:53:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I was going to ask for something more... formal, but with recent news... I would be most happy for something... fun? *looks like she hasn't said such a word in a while*
22:53:47 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Fun and formal don't have to be mutually exclusive....
22:54:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Sorry, if that is a bit vague. I just feel like I need some time to take care of myself before I can help others.
22:54:42 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: That lovely purple hair....I imagine I could make something that would highlight that....Mm? Oh, assuredly. If you're limping along, you can't exactly carry someone else, now, can you?
22:55:42 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles with a more genuine smile than before, glad to be understood
22:56:18 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well! I'll do everything in my power to create the perfect outfit.....first things first, though, we'll need some wine. -Then- you can look at my portfolio...0
22:56:36 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I would like that
22:56:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: There's a wine shop right around the corner. My treat!
22:57:01 Eloise-CenarionCircle sashays towards the exit!
22:57:09 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: That sounds wonderful. But first... *looks down at the tabby* let me hand him off to Allison
22:57:28 Eloise-CenarionCircle grins.
22:57:44 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hello miss Allison, her is the little rascal. Mind if you could watch him for the usual rate?
22:58:09 Zuberius blows Eloise-CenarionCircle a kiss.
22:58:24 Adlanna-SistersofElune | Innkeeper Allison says: Sure thing, Miss Adlanna! I will try and keep him out of -too- much trouble.
22:59:02 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles and gives the tabby one more pat before placing him in Allison's arms. He sinks right in and purrs at her petting
22:59:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Have a good day, both of you.
22:59:22 Eloise-CenarionCircle waves goodbye to Innkeeper Allison.  Farewell!
22:59:45 Adlanna-SistersofElune navigates to the exit, nodding her head in greeting to the nearby worgen
22:59:52 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Shall we go?
22:59:58 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: We shall!
23:00:49 Julia Gallina says: Let me know if you need help finding anything, mage.
23:01:09 Adlanna-SistersofElune manages to suceed in not checking Eloise out on the way over to the Wine bar
23:01:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I don't know why I'm bothering to browse, I usually get the noir....for this sort of outing, that is....
23:01:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Do you like noir?
23:02:22 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I do. Julia and those her offered me a free tasting before, and liked drinking it whenever I could find time to stop over.
23:02:45 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Noir it is, then!
23:02:53 Eloise-CenarionCircle purchases some wine.
23:03:18 Adlanna-SistersofElune accepts a few of the bottles from Eloise
23:03:29 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Thank you Eloise, as well as you Julia.
23:03:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: An important forst step.
23:03:41 Eloise-CenarionCircle grins wickedly.
23:03:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Now then!
23:03:54 Julia Gallina says: When you are at the Brewfest grounds, have a drink for me, hunter!
23:04:10 Adlanna-SistersofElune | Julia Gallina smiles at the two leaving and waves politely
23:04:39 Shepherd pets Sleeper.
23:04:46 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: A bit of wine will get our creative sides a bit of a pinch.
23:04:56 Shepherd whistles at Sleeper.
23:05:36 Eloise-CenarionCircle greets everyone warmly.
23:05:51 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles as she feels the refreshing warmth from the wine wash through her
23:05:51 Airmedd-CenarionCircle greets Eloise-CenarionCircle warmly.
23:05:57 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at Airmedd-CenarionCircle.
23:06:15 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well, I know I'll need some thread....
23:06:31 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mmm- oh.
23:06:37 Adlanna-SistersofElune thinks for minute "While we're here, I might want to check my field supplies as well."
23:06:48 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Yes? *she tilts her head*
23:07:03 Erich Lohan says: Free drinks at the Blue Recluse!
23:07:09 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: here, you'll want a look through this....*she digs in her pack, pulling out a book*
23:07:37 Eloise-CenarionCircle hands Adlanna her [Tailoring] portfolio.
23:08:06 Adlanna-SistersofElune graciously takes the book into her hands, carefully looking at it before opening it up
23:08:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Flip through, see if anything jumps out at you....if something strikes your fancy we can collaborate from there.
23:09:36 Adlanna-SistersofElune flips through a few pages, looking at the contents "Hmm..."
23:10:19 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks over various spools of thread, and trails her fingers along bolts of cloth.
23:10:32 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh, when did this come in....
23:10:48 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Oh... these all look beautiful! It seems hard to choose...
23:11:04 Adlanna-SistersofElune seems to have a spark in her eyes
23:11:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Hmhm!~ I can see where it might be overwhelming, at first...I've been adding patterns for -quite- a while....
23:11:45 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: This one would go well with my hair down... and this one shows just enough skin for a fancy dinner party... And this one and this one-
23:11:56 [Airmedd-CenarionCircle]: Pardon me ladies, have a fine evening.
23:12:02 Adlanna-SistersofElune catches herself from speaking rapidly and blushes
23:12:10 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Uh... thank you very much.
23:12:15 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
23:12:26 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Sorry, I didn't think that- I-I mean... Ugh!
23:12:38 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Like a dehydrated person in the desert. Adorable!~
23:12:41 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I haven't this much fun since I got to style my sister all up for her birthdays!
23:12:57 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles warmly.
23:13:07 Erich Lohan says: Best drinks in Stormwind!
23:13:11 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: My mother had no fashion, so I had to learn from her mistakes *she says it with a deadpan look, then grinned*
23:13:20 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Then you know how delightful it is for me.
23:13:59 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Truely... If it wasn't for the travel, I think I would be someone interested in theater and music... At least, when I was younger.
23:14:14 Adlanna-SistersofElune she looks back at the book and furrows her brow
23:14:40 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hmm... *flips a few pages over* I think... ah hah!
23:14:42 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mmm...no reason to give it up....taverns will usually hire someone for an evening or two...passing bards....
23:14:58 Adlanna-SistersofElune nods excitedly, then points to a specific depiction
23:15:06 Eloise-CenarionCircle setps beside her to look at which page she's on.
23:15:51 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Something caught your eye?~
23:16:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I think... this one with the casual but relaxed cut would be great. It is not quite a party outfit, but relaxed enough that I wouldn't mind showing off at a small gathering.
23:19:02 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((oh... btw, I totally missed what you meant by linking to your profession... please hold as I now actually pick the item XD))
23:19:05 Erich Lohan says: Feeling blue? Come on down to the Blue Recluse for a good time!
23:22:58 Airmedd-CenarionCircle bows down graciously.
23:25:29 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((okay, almost done - how do the phoenix pants look?))
23:26:08 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks at the rendition of [Phoenix Pants].
23:26:41 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Ahhh, I see...something with a bit of flair....but not over-the-top....mhm, mhm...
23:26:51 Adlanna-SistersofElune points to the [Lavender Mageweave Shirt] as well
23:27:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Not sure if it is too flashy pairing though...
23:27:24 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well...you want to turn some heads, right?
23:27:52 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: usually I wear more subdued colors cause of my hair during the hunt but... yes, I would -love- that to be honest.
23:28:14 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: The purple would give your hair a "pop"....
23:28:42 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Probably your complexion, as well....
23:29:18 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles, then deadpans "Well, I definetely find this more exciting than when I would find myself asking my pet tiger fashion opinions."
23:29:41 Adlanna-SistersofElune then giggles, still feeling the lingering affects of the wine
23:29:59 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Your....i don't know if they have a name....the markings, on your face, too...the red in the pants would be a little flash for those....
23:30:22 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Of course, you'd need a pair of shoes to go with...
23:30:39 Eloise-CenarionCircle moves back around to look at the book again.
23:31:09 Erich Lohan says: Magical studies stressing your brain? Relax at the Blue Recluse!
23:31:25 Adlanna-SistersofElune perks up, nodding "Yes, and something a bit less bland than travel boots would be great."
23:31:53 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Unless you want to go barefoot.....You might be able to pull that off, not everyone can.
23:32:37 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: But, look at those....*she points to the [Red Woolen Boots]*
23:32:57 Adlanna-SistersofElune raises a hand and fiddles with her hair, then looks at what Eloise is drawing her attention to
23:33:18 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Those would look nice...
23:33:46 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: A red base...draws up to the red in the pants....then purple on top, going right up to your hair....
23:33:55 Adlanna-SistersofElune then giggles "I would look more like a sunset than a stealthy hunter!"
23:34:03 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: And that would be perfect...
23:34:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If your aim is to get a bit of attention in social gatherings, I'd say this definitely would do the trick....
23:35:41 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: And it isn't as if I'm sewing you -into- the clothes. If you tire of the look, toss them in a trunk and we'll set you up with something else!
23:35:54 Adlanna-SistersofElune takes out another bottle from her pouch and drinks some while pondering
23:36:30 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Well... I do find myself always wanting to try different styles. But this would be perfect for now.
23:36:52 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Excellent!
23:37:12 Erich Lohan says: Free drinks at the Blue Recluse!
23:39:29 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Let me see...the only thing I don't have on hand is the pearl, for the clasp on those pants. I can run out and snag one, I'm sure. If you want to go to the dressing room upstairs and peel out of that..ahh, hunting, outfit, I'll come back and take your mea
23:39:48 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: measurements.*
23:40:14 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: That would be... great!
23:40:22 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles.
23:40:32 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'll try to be quick!
23:40:41 Adlanna-SistersofElune tries to cover over her slight uneasiness over something, but smiles nonetheless
23:42:15 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Good, I found one- oh, she's upstairs, right...ahh, what else do I need....
23:42:34 Eloise-CenarionCircle makes a few purchases from Alexandra Bolero.
23:42:44 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at Alexandra Bolero.
23:42:49 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Thank you dear.
23:43:07 Erich Lohan says: Ask me how to get a free drink at the Blue Recluse!
23:43:07 Adlanna-SistersofElune appears but tries to hide a bit uneasy as she faces toward the wall
23:43:11 Eloise-CenarionCircle raps at the door. "Knock knooock!~"
23:43:19 Erich Lohan says: Head on over to the Blue Recluse. Where everybody knows your name!
23:43:43 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Oh, hi there... *her hands hovering over her waist as she tries to hide the nasty scars she has*
23:44:09 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I think I'm ready whenever you are *she looks both nervous but also flushed at the same time
23:44:39 Eloise-CenarionCircle comes in. She -briefly- looks taken aback at the sheer amount of scarring, but almost instantly has the same charming smile on her face again.
23:45:23 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I have to say, I love designing for you elves. Your skin tones are so...exotic!
23:45:36 Adlanna-SistersofElune gazes a bit off to the side, but then forces herself to stare toward Eloise
23:45:44 Eloise-CenarionCircle sets down an armload of supplies.
23:45:47 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: T-thank you...
23:46:00 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
23:46:30 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((oh, btw, off topic but look at the #event section in the SoE discord))
23:46:58 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles back, face mixed with various emotions
23:47:07 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: It's quite alright dear. The scars, I mean....don't be embarrassed. I'm off-and-on dating a demon huntress. So scars don't really phase me at this point.
23:47:10 Eloise-CenarionCircle grins at you wickedly.
23:48:26 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((hahaha - thats great. Not to say im much different - never have owned a smart phone ever))
23:48:58 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes again some more "I-I appriciate it. I was surprised this is all that resulted from the last week or so..."
23:49:06 Eloise-CenarionCircle slings a knotted cord over her shoulders, finding her small notebook with clients' measurements in it, and a pencil. She flips to a new page.
23:49:10 Erich Lohan says: Feeling blue? Come on down to the Blue Recluse for a good time!
23:49:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Alright...Aleia...let's get your dimensions down....
23:50:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: if you could hold your arms out, to the sides....like wings....
23:51:07 Adlanna-SistersofElune stands a bit straighter, and stretches them out "I will do so... but be warned I can be a bit... sensitive to touch at times"
23:51:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If I tickle you, I'll watch for flying elbows. 
23:51:49 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
23:52:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ... and they will fly. *she tries to sound serious, but not making to much headway*
23:52:28 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((WILL*))
23:52:41 Eloise-CenarionCircle takes a series of measurements: From shoulder to elbow, elbow to wrist...around the wrist, and the bicep....
23:53:06 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Alright, alright...not too bad so far, mmm?
23:53:26 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: No... it seems comfortable.
23:53:35 Eloise-CenarionCircle measures around Adlanna's neck, and from the nape down to her waistline.
23:54:05 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I've never been accused of being ham-handed, so, I have that going for me...~
23:54:23 Eloise-CenarionCircle chuckles a bit, measuring around the waist, and the hips.
23:54:53 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Just ooone more up here.....
23:54:56 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles "I wouldn't know what that would entail, in any case."
23:55:05 Erich Lohan says: Best drinks in Stormwind!
23:55:21 Erich Lohan says: Best drinks in Stormwind!
23:55:59 Eloise-CenarionCircle puts her arms around the elf, taking the cord in her hand after slinging it around Adlanna's back. She brings it around for a measurement at the bustline.
23:56:31 Eloise-CenarionCircle pulls the cord away. "Splendid."
23:56:42 Adlanna-SistersofElune eeps slightly, but relaxes
23:56:51 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((oops - key binding))
23:57:01 Eloise-CenarionCircle pats at Adlanna's arm. "You can drop them, now."
23:57:28 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes and drops them
23:57:41 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Now, if you'd be so kind as to stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart....
23:58:22 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Sure. *follows Eloise's instructions*
23:58:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Straighten your legs, but you needn't lock the knees or anything. Just as natural a stance as you can.
23:58:56 Eloise-CenarionCircle kneels down.
23:59:07 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Alright...
23:59:37 Eloise-CenarionCircle takes a few more measurements: around the widest part of the thigh, around the knee, and around the ankle.
00:00:11 Eloise-CenarionCircle measures on the outside of the leg, from hip to knee.
00:00:42 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Okay...doing good! Almost done. Just the last one, is a bit...
00:01:09 Erich Lohan says: Magical studies stressing your brain? Relax at the Blue Recluse!
00:01:20 Erich Lohan says: Feeling blue? Come on down to the Blue Recluse for a good time!
00:01:29 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well. It's the inseam. I'll be getting, -near-, ahh...."it". If you catch my meaning.
00:01:45 Eloise-CenarionCircle blushes a bit, but smiles up at her.
00:02:03 Adlanna-SistersofElune bluesh heavily, but nods her head "That would be... fine"
00:02:27 Eloise-CenarionCircle sets one end of the cord at Adlanna's ankle, and draws the cord up the length of her leg, on the inside.
00:02:38 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: and, there.
00:02:55 Eloise-CenarionCircle slings the cord back around her neck, and jots down the last note.
00:03:05 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Wasn't so bad, right?
00:03:09 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
00:03:26 Adlanna-SistersofElune shudders slightly, but tries her best "It was good..."
00:03:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Now we just need a tracing of your feet....
00:03:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: For a shoe size....
00:04:05 Eloise-CenarionCircle grabs a square of leather.
00:04:10 Eloise-CenarionCircle kneels down.
00:04:22 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Just stand on this, as flat-footed as you can.
00:05:04 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Alright
00:05:20 Adlanna-SistersofElune stands on top of it, shifting her weight until she is completely balanced
00:05:53 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Great...*she uses the pencil to trace around Adlanna's feet, pressing down into the leather a bit to score it*
00:06:08 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Aaand...there.
00:06:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Now, just make yourself comfortable, and I'll get it all put together!



[MISSED LOGS]



01:48:33 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles gently.
01:48:57 Adlanna-SistersofElune seems to be on the verge of crying, and another blue pulse less faint passing through her eyes
01:49:12 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: It...never really goes away....not, -all- the way, away...but it dulls. Oh-....hmm.
01:49:25 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks at her eyes.
01:50:01 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Not sure what that was....
01:50:13 Eloise-CenarionCircle rubs an eye with the heel of a hand.
01:50:17 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: H-huh... *she says with a tinge of hollowness* I guess-
01:50:46 Adlanna-SistersofElune suddenly feels a sharp piercing headache "Ack!"
01:50:52 Eloise-CenarionCircle blinks at you.
01:51:04 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Aleia..? Are you alright?
01:51:53 Adlanna-SistersofElune raises a hand to rub her temples while in pain "It hurts... but not... sure if this similar to yesterday..."
01:52:30 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I... was found by Cleon... in great pain in a nightmare I couldn't seem to wake up from...
01:52:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh....what happened yesterday..?
01:53:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: It was... *the pain lessened, though another pulse - this time only in her right eye - echoed*
01:53:25 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks concerned, and moves in front of the elf.
01:53:46 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I keep...thinking I sense something....
01:54:02 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I'm not quite sure what, but it was shortly after I learned about... what happened to Teldrasill and Darkshore while I was away...
01:54:26 Eloise-CenarionCircle chews her lip a bit at the mention.
01:54:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Yes...just...awful.....
01:55:11 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I had just recieved a letter that one's had tried to deliver to me for almost a year from my.... m-my mother in Darkshore.
01:55:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: A few weeks ago
01:55:31 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh, dear....
01:56:23 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: And I had been working up my courage to go back and discuss some of what, in her words "needed to be settled about your father and about you"
01:56:32 Eloise-CenarionCircle looks at the elf's eyes carefully, but can't seem to sense what she had before.
01:56:47 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I see....
01:57:06 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Could I try something..?
01:57:45 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I may be able to help with that headache....
01:57:47 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: U-um... *she opens her eyes as the pain reduced to a more managable amount and looked at Eloise*
01:58:22 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: T-truely? I-I just still don't know why I have been having such... All because of my unresolved feelings?
01:58:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Possibly...stress can do...odd things to a body.
01:58:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I... just want... *she seems back on the verge of tears*
01:59:18 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: F-first my father was murdered by someone unknown... and then I hurt my sister in grief...
01:59:25 Eloise-CenarionCircle holds her middle and ring fingers in, extending the pinkies and forefingers, and thumbs.
01:59:34 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: A-and now...
02:00:22 Eloise-CenarionCircle reaches for Adlanna's face- forefingers to temples, thumbs at the cheekbones, and pinkies pressing below the ear, where the jaw meets the neck.
02:01:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I just want- *a shudder runs through her face as her right eye seems to glow again in response to her emotions*
02:01:32 Eloise-CenarionCircle 's hands thrum with a low vibration. Nothing invasive; just a humming energy.
02:02:02 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: It's alright, Aleia...take a deep breath.....
02:02:52 Adlanna-SistersofElune feels the energy pulsing her head slightly "O-okay..."
02:03:35 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Sometimes....just a little vibration can lessen a headache.....you haven't always had them?
02:03:37 Adlanna-SistersofElune breaths in deep as another tremour of grief strikes down her spin
02:04:43 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: N-no... only since yesterday when... I can't quite remember what happened during my dream, but I feel like my mind is missing something important that happened during it...
02:05:01 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Probably not migraines, then....
02:05:31 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: And then when Cleon helped me wake, I could feel nothing but sharp pain all over... but especially in my eyes and... heart?
02:06:18 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I only remember something similar to it the day after we had to recieve my father's dead body from the hunters that found him...
02:06:43 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Your eyes....it's not very common for night elves to have that color....
02:06:52 Adlanna-SistersofElune continues to take several more deep breaths as the vibration seems to help calm her emotions as the pain lessens
02:07:22 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: And you said you felt...trapped, in a nightmare...?
02:07:39 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: M-my eye color? *She is still unaware that her right eye is still occationally pulsing a blue light*
02:08:06 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mhm....amber is pretty uncommon, from what I understand.....
02:09:11 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Huh... my father said that was just something he and his brother - my uncle - had. I thought it was just because they had grown up with the talent of druids...
02:09:46 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: But regarding the dream... I felt trapped during it, but at the end...
02:09:51 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: One, that I know of, is Illidan. And his brother is Malfurion. Who is- right, he's....a really...druid-ey druid. The druid-ey-est, I believe.
02:10:37 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: The eye color and having powerful dreams, makes me think that you should confer with a druid or two.....
02:11:12 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: You may have latent talents, or something, that are waking up.....and it could be causing you...distress.....
02:11:42 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: The strange thing is... I know from my uncle about some of the process of becoming a druid, though not much.
02:12:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: One last thing that I seem to be only remembering pieces of
02:12:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: How does your head feel now..?
02:12:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: In my dream - or nightmare - I could feel the presense of some kind of light healing magic... but also something more... raw
02:13:04 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-it feels like I could manage
02:13:43 Adlanna-SistersofElune blinks her eyes as she notices her head hurts far less than earlier. The blue glow in her one eye all but dissapears
02:14:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I am sorry, I didn't think that... perhaps I have been bottling things up inside more than I thought...
02:14:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Managing is not relaxing, on your relaxing-after-a-terrible-week, night. here...
02:14:47 Eloise-CenarionCircle scoots back a bit, sitting on her heels. She pats her lap.
02:15:07 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Lie your head on my lap. I'll keep going.
02:15:21 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes a bit again, but her face reveals a sense of relief she didn't think she would feel
02:15:35 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Alright... If that would be permissible by you.
02:15:46 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Of course, sweetie.
02:16:26 Adlanna-SistersofElune shyly draws closer, laying closer to the ground as she tenitivly lays her head on Eloise's knees
02:16:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Some aspects of druidic magic are akin to arcanistry.....
02:17:43 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: So it's -possible- I'm helping a bit more than just overwhelming the nerves that are in pain with vibrations.
02:19:27 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I have heard that... though whenever I would ask my family other than my uncle about druidic and arcane magic, they seems to clam up and find excuses never to tell me anything.
02:19:41 Eloise-CenarionCircle smooths Adlanna's hair a bit, and strokes up along her ear, before holding her fingers juuust so, and slow-pushing the latent mana around the elf's head, looking for any obvious, glaring anomalies.
02:20:38 Adlanna-SistersofElune sighs abit in relaxation, the feeling alien yet -so- comforting to her mind and soul
02:20:58 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: From what I understand...the ones who exclusively practice one...did -not- get along with the ones that did the other....
02:21:39 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Kind of....what happened with the whole....Sundering.....
02:22:12 Adlanna-SistersofElune sighs "That was as far as my uncle would tell me. Others I met said my father and him were ancient, but would not say anything about their past to me."
02:23:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Maybe they... knew of such things? And... about the Sundering... my father would always seem to cry whenever I asked about that time in history...
02:23:55 Adlanna-SistersofElune feels her eyes close as Elosie's care continued to relax her, making her content where she was
02:24:10 Eloise-CenarionCircle , finding nothing she can readily discern, resumes stroking the elf's hair, enhanced with the magical-vibration.
02:24:39 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If he was around when it happened...I can't imagine he'd like to relive any of it....
02:26:05 Adlanna-SistersofElune felt tired, but also something tingly deep within what she thought could be her mind. "Maybe mother knew something about him they did not want me to know until I grew older."
02:26:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: -My- mother almost has a coronary if anyone brings up the time Lady Portleront found a spot on her salad fork at Mother's....big something-or-other gala. Half of the world exploding -has- to be worse than that. For anyone who isn't my mother. 
02:26:37 Eloise-CenarionCircle grins down at Adlanna.
02:27:17 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles too, opening one of her eyes to gaze up at Eloise
02:28:09 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Who would have thought I would have ones as kind as you to help me face my demons when there likely is more deserving ones of such care...
02:28:42 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I just... don't know what else to feel about the future but determination to help others find the peace that eludes me at times...
02:29:20 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Pfff....who decides who's deserving of what...? You're here, we seem to get along...-I- say you deserve it.
02:30:06 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I think you should speak to some druids, though....about the nightmares, at least. Or, not being able to wake.
02:30:46 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I guess so...
02:31:23 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'm perfectly happy to talk to you about any of this....but, if you remember something...really bad, or important, that you think you really need help with...not, magically, but ehh....
02:31:35 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: help, mentally?
02:32:08 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: One of my co-workers is a kind of...counselor. A therapist, she says.
02:32:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hmm... I guess that would be something that could help me... *another blue flash can be seen from that eye almost in response to her sad voice, almost swirlling with some kind of magical aura not unlike the channeling of manna*
02:33:17 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: *It then dissapeared as quickly as is appeared, without alerting adlanna*
02:33:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: She did it for the Army of the Light for a couple thousand years, so....I assume she knows what she's doing.
02:34:23 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I would... like that. I feel that these weights of guilt... pain... anger... that they only grew more painful when I hid myself away.
02:34:48 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Don't feel that I'm foisting you off, though. If you want to talk to me, please come to me. I just want you to know that there may be some things I'm not...trained to deal with. Understand..?
02:36:04 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I agree... "A hunter is only as good as his mind, for only whole can one fight off the impossible." Another... lesson he taught me during our sessions when I was half my current age.
02:37:03 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at her, and rubs at her temples, bouncing a pulse of mana back and forth between her fingers.
02:37:10 Adlanna-SistersofElune still feels the relaxing effects of the wine from earlier, and she snuggles her head a bit more into Eloise's lap
02:37:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Her name is Auula, if you decide to ask after her.
02:38:58 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I think... that would be wise on my part. And as for a druid to talk to... Maybe it is high time I also try to find if my uncle made it through the ordeal. If anyone could help answer questions about something about my dream, it would be that essentric
02:38:58 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: elf.
02:39:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Eloise...
02:39:24 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mhm..?
02:40:04 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: T-thank you for everything today. Your kindness, your understanding of... *she blushes and looks down at her figiting hands* my feelings...
02:40:40 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: But also, thank you for your concern. I don't know how long it would have taken on my own to open up to someone about this without a situation like this...
02:41:35 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Of course, dear. I'm glad to. It seems like you're feeling a bit better, now?
02:42:36 Adlanna-SistersofElune smiles gracefully "A lot better than I was alone in my bedroom balling like a young infant."
02:42:52 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: That rarely help. *she grins*
02:43:24 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Though cuddling with a fluffy tiger sometimes has it's perks...
02:43:45 Eloise-CenarionCircle leans over for a bite of food. She....bounces intriguingly.
02:43:46 Adlanna-SistersofElune opens her eyes wide "N-not that this doesn't surpass that!"
02:43:53 Eloise-CenarionCircle laughs.
02:44:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: it must be a comfort. They're fuzzy and warm, I imagine. Can't say I've ever curled up with a tiger.
02:45:27 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: A worgen, I have. But we weren't really -cuddling-. *her cheeks redden a bit!*
02:46:08 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks up with a spark of amusement and intrigue in her eyes
02:46:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: *Ahem*
02:46:56 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Let's just say that that's where I learned a good deal about arcanistry and druidic magic being....meld-able.
02:47:25 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushed
02:47:59 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I would ask more, but I am certainly not someone who has any kind of experience in... things such as that.
02:48:09 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I actually didn't know he was a worgen for a few weeks. He had it very much under control. Because of the druid training.
02:49:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: But, he was concerned that he might hurt me, if he ever...worgened..? Too hard. For whatever reason. So we....experimented. 
02:50:14 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Ah... *her blush infensified!*
02:50:26 Eloise-CenarionCircle laughs a bit.
02:50:45 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Well, in any event... im sure tabby wouldn't mind the extra attention from other females.
02:51:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: He seems to be well on his way to being popular, though Raija seems to scold him when he gets too shifty
02:51:25 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'd pet a tiger if it was a hunter's tiger. Probably....
02:51:32 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Maybe.
02:51:45 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Maybe not. At all. They're -huge-.
02:51:51 Eloise-CenarionCircle quietly snickers to herself.
02:52:10 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Tabby isn't more than a small cat - you saw him when we met earlier. Raija is the one you need to worry about.
02:52:40 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh, I need to worry about that one, mm? Going to sic them on me, are you?~
02:53:53 Adlanna-SistersofElune rolls her eyes and groans "As if she would even listen to me if I ever did that... I think sometimes she is secretly an elf in disguise and just refuses to talk"
02:54:07 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Hmhm!
02:54:23 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Not to mention she seemed to treat me like her child most of the years we spent alone together.
02:55:24 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: No? Not going to aim for a few well-placed slashes on one of my dresses?~ *she says teasingly, turning a bit to show the cutaway side of the dress*
02:56:22 Adlanna-SistersofElune stares for a bit, then closes her eyes with a smirk, feeling a growing familiarity with Eloise
02:56:33 Eloise-CenarionCircle lilts a laugh.
02:56:34 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Who says I would need Raija to do that for me?
02:56:44 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh-ho!~
02:57:19 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: So -you- want to tear at it, then?
02:57:56 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Uhh, well I-
02:58:16 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes again as she feels like she is no match to Eloise when it comes to flirting
02:58:28 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Alright, I give...
02:58:35 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: it -is- almost only half-a-dress.....I wouldn't have to do much to repair it.....
02:59:05 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I guess so...
02:59:25 Eloise-CenarionCircle shrugs a little, causing her busom to jumble pleasantly.
03:00:19 Adlanna-SistersofElune stares up at it for a moment before looking away with a kind of guilty look covering her face
03:00:33 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh- awww....
03:00:52 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: ..what's the matter...?
03:00:57 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Well...
03:01:31 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I  do not know how my feelings for you might lead to, or if this will be how we be toward each other from now on but...
03:01:57 Eloise-CenarionCircle arches a brow, listening.
03:02:22 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I am glad to have at least a good friend in you... and maybe I would like something more but...
03:03:00 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: It wouldn't be my place to try and make something out of what has only occured over a mere few weeks. But... perhaps we could learn more about each other as time goes on...
03:03:20 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Ahh. Hmhm...
03:03:49 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Well- you most definitely should -not- do anything that you feel you aren't ready for. But...
03:05:01 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: It does go back to the waiting, thing, I mentioned before. If you are. If you aren't, that's fine! But if uhh..you are, then...well.... 
03:05:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I mean. if you wanted to kiss me, it doesn't mean we're married. or that you have to do it again.
03:06:34 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks up at her, a growing attraction showing in her eyes, only slightly tempered by her fears
03:06:56 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles.
03:07:47 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If you want to, I wouldn't begrudge it. And if you found out you didn't after that, I wouldn't...be an ass about it, or anything.
03:08:18 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Believe you me, I do not lack for attention in -that- department.
03:08:20 Eloise-CenarionCircle grins wickedly.
03:09:08 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: *blushes, then looks into her eyes with a little more bravery* I-If I said I was and we did try... "us", would we still be able to stay friends even if things didn't work out, or if I ended up a basket case at the end of all of my issues?
03:10:18 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I... would like to take a chance on something rather than wait and regret like I did with not talking things out with my mother before... all of this
03:12:07 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I think...you're overthinking it....there doesn't have to be an "us"....there's you, and me. We can do things together. if one of us decides to stop doing them, the other can be an adult about it and look elsewhere for those things....
03:12:40 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If you want to marry an orc and never kiss me again I'd make your wedding gown.
03:13:13 Adlanna-SistersofElune gives a small sob, but with a smile at the end
03:13:47 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: maybe what you need right now if more along the lines of a hug, though...
03:14:08 Adlanna-SistersofElune sits up a bit, pausing for a bit before nodding
03:14:14 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: You still seem a bit upset....
03:14:32 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Yeah... I think I would like one of those
03:14:56 Eloise-CenarionCircle sidles up against Adlanna and wraps her in her arms.
03:15:42 Adlanna-SistersofElune takes a deep breath before returning the hug with a firm but gentle grasp "T-thank you..."
03:16:31 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Quite alright, dear. I'm a bit of a flirt. Wouldn't want to put you in a pinch over it.
03:16:58 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'd just kick myself if I let you go off thinking I had -zero- interest at all.
03:17:03 Eloise-CenarionCircle chuckles a bit.
03:19:55 Adlanna-SistersofElune lingers for a few moments, just feeling comfortable among the gentle presence of Eloise "I am greatful for all this help... as well as the jewl you are as a person. It seems I have been blessed to have such good people around me..."
03:20:31 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Maybe the goddess did see my tears in the forests and d-decided to show her care for m-me...
03:20:51 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Oh, come now....I'm only being....normal. Or it should be normal.
03:21:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: It should be normal to want to hug someone who looks like they're about to cry. And then make them new clothes.~
03:23:27 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: In any event, I am glad that our lights have crossed. I... think I may need to do some more soul searching and perhaps take you up on your offer to talk to your friend... Auula was her name?
03:24:02 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Yes, I think you have given me more help in your own way then I would ever be able to do on my own even if I lived to be as old as this tree here.
03:24:28 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles.
03:24:50 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'm glad you're feeling better. And yes, her name is Auula.
03:27:50 Eloise-CenarionCircle tucks a lock of Adlanna's hair behind her ear.
03:28:11 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Got a bit rumpled laying in my lap, I see.
03:28:41 Eloise-CenarionCircle adjusts Adlanna's collar a bit, and just generally fusses over her a little.
03:29:08 Adlanna-SistersofElune blushes, then chuckles a bit "I guess... but I think it was worth it."
03:29:19 Eloise-CenarionCircle smiles at you.
03:29:55 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I'd say so.
03:30:37 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: You have a few ideas about the things that are troubling you. And it proves that my stitching is still as resilient as ever.~
03:32:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I would say so... Maybe Raija wouldn't have a chance with her claws after all.
03:32:34 Eloise-CenarionCircle laughs.
03:32:57 Adlanna-SistersofElune laughs with her
03:33:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Tiger-proof stitching...now -that- might get me a patent.....
03:34:37 Eloise-CenarionCircle sighs a bit, leaning her head on Adlanna's shoulder.
03:35:22 Adlanna-SistersofElune leans in a bit in response, starting out at the sky past the tree
03:37:05 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Sometimes you just need to sit under a tree at night, I guess.
03:37:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I probably needed this nearly as much as you did.
03:38:01 Eloise-CenarionCircle flexes her left hand and wrist.
03:38:14 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: The peace of a true wild forest does allow for beautiful moments like this
03:40:37 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I think I may need to adjust the enchantment-matrices on my bracers.
03:42:07 Adlanna-SistersofElune has a puzzled face as she looks closer at her hand. "I'm sorry I do not know much about such things. Is that... something you use for battle, or does it serve another purpose?
03:42:30 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Primarily in battle, yes....
03:43:11 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Repeated manipulation of ley and weft is....mmm....
03:43:43 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: I make certain motions to cast a spell, right? You might see my arm go out, like this...
03:43:52 Eloise-CenarionCircle moves her arm in a small gesture.
03:44:25 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks as confuddled and curious as a tiny kitten, but takes in Eloise's words seriously as she pays rapt attention
03:45:22 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: But it isn't, just that movement. It is also moving, within the magic. That one movement is effectively many movements. It's....somewhat like a vibration. It's here, there, here, rapidly. Just not where one can see it.
03:46:05 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mages often use complementary magic woven into their clothing to dampen the feedback.
03:46:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: That seems quite complex.
03:46:34 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Seems to love my wrists, so bracers, lately.
03:48:54 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hmm... my father and uncle seemed to favor their hands and arms more so than normal for hunters... Maybe something similar that druids deal with.
03:49:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: But... in any case... does it hurt?
03:49:29 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: They're a bit sore today....
03:50:34 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hmm...
03:51:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((ok, this was one of the best rp sessions I have had. I really hate to have to cut it here, but I better get some sleep while I still can b4 I got to go to work :d ))
03:52:13 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: (( heehee! no problem!  ))
03:52:18 Adlanna-SistersofElune yawns, reaching up with her right hand to rub at her eyes
03:52:51 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Sleepy?
03:53:10 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I think... that all this crying and headaches and... beautiful moments have made me ready to sleep on a rock with no trouble.
03:53:37 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Hmhm....well, luckily, you don't have to....
03:53:59 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: If you want to return to Stormwind, just say the word!
03:54:38 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: You'll be back in your inn room with your cat before you know it.
03:55:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: And then Raija won't want to sink her claws into you before we test whether your fabric is REALLY tiger proof. *She smirks slightly*
03:55:43 Eloise-CenarionCircle chuckles.
03:56:09 Eloise-CenarionCircle gives Adlanna's back a pat.
03:56:18 Eloise-CenarionCircle stretches.
03:56:51 Adlanna-SistersofElune yawns again, pushing her hands out in a familiar pattern for her before pushing herself up and repeating a pattern of brief stretches with her back
03:56:55 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: let's get you to your bed, mmm? 
03:57:25 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Yes, thank you.
03:57:36 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Certainly.
03:57:41 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Say... one last thing
03:57:51 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Mhm..?
03:58:12 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: How will Lucy react if and when she picks up on some of our scent on each other...?
03:58:40 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: She was one of the people that directed me to you about being a clothing expert...
03:59:26 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: Pfff....may as well ask how an.....ettin would react to....calculus. I have no idea how or why Lucy will react to anything at any given time.
03:59:35 You laugh.
03:59:35 Eloise-CenarionCircle lets out a hearty chuckle.
03:59:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: That is most definetely true!
04:00:33 [Eloise-CenarionCircle]: We shall see, I suppose!
04:00:50 Eloise-CenarionCircle begins tracing runes in the air....
04:01:46 Adlanna-SistersofElune steps through, finding herself in a familiar location
