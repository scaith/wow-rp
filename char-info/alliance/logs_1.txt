22:31:58 To [Vryl-CenarionCircle]: ((thank you for that awesome session!))
22:33:15 [Vryl-CenarionCircle] whispers: (( :D Glad ya liked it! Haven't really RP'ed this one yet.....this is an Eloise alt, by the way xD ))
22:35:24 To [Vryl-CenarionCircle]: ((oh cool XD - it made me have to rewrite some of my characters lore on the fly cause of a lack of knowledge of the current lore - still on early quests and things. Now my future hooks with Adlanna is clear))
22:36:25 To [Vryl-CenarionCircle]: ((clearer*))
22:37:13 [Vryl-CenarionCircle] whispers: (( yeah, it's kinda weird to try and mesh lower-level toons with current events....I kind of just headcanon it as quasi-memories or whatever xD ))
22:38:22 [Vryl-CenarionCircle] whispers: ((also, if ya have RP or game questions, I'd be happy to help out if I can! You can add me on Bnet if you want to, since it's probably virtually impossible to keep track of all my alts, lol))
22:39:34 To [Vryl-CenarionCircle]: ((you can say that again XD. that would be great - adlanna is likely going to want to meet with Eloise again regarding tailor stuff... and maybe other things will result))
22:40:06 [Vryl-CenarionCircle] whispers: (( Huzzah!  xD  my battle.net tag iiiiis....))
22:40:24 [Vryl-CenarionCircle] whispers: (( Sippycup#1896 ))

23:43:17 [Cleon-CenarionCircle] whispers: (he actually didnt see it cuz he was too far away, im in call with him tho and told him)
23:45:02 To [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ((It's multiple deep slashes from swords - its kinda healed mostly from the original almost deadly state by some doctors, but not quite as its not been treated very well by Adlanna lately))
23:45:23 [Cleon-CenarionCircle] whispers: (thank u)
