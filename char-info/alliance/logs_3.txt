23:18:53 Atlaas-CenarionCircle nods at Cleon-CenarionCircle.
23:18:55 Atlaas-CenarionCircle nods at Cleon-CenarionCircle.
23:18:57 Cleon-CenarionCircle cries on Atlaas-CenarionCircle's shoulder.
23:19:02 Atlaas-CenarionCircle laughs at Cleon-CenarionCircle.
23:19:12 Cleon-CenarionCircle makes a rude gesture at Atlaas-CenarionCircle.
23:19:13 You look at Cat and cover your face with your palm.
23:19:14 Atlaas-CenarionCircle nods at Cleon-CenarionCircle.
23:19:26 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: (OK THAT DIDNT ACTUALLY HAPPEN WE'RE JUST BEING FART NUGGETS NOW)
23:19:35 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: (FSATNUGGIES)
23:19:53 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: (ok enough! to recap they were talking about his dying mom)
23:20:22 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...It's the only chance she's got.
23:20:32 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Well,We should probably ask her as soon as possible then.
23:20:50 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: In the morning I'll confront her about it. I don't know where she would be at this hour.
23:21:05 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...Everything has been kinda nasty for everyone recently, hasn't it?
23:21:19 Human Commoner says: Here's to the Alliance!
23:21:19 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: First Mo, then me, then you... Now poor Adlanna.
23:21:54 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I know.. seems that the times lately have been difficult for all..
23:22:06 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: What do you think could have made her cry like that?...
23:22:36 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I haven't a clue.. I mean I only met her recently at The event in Pandaria.
23:22:50 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I haven't seen her since then, but my heart aches for her.
23:22:51 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((okay, here are the conditions - while Adlanna doesn't like to lie, she has wandered by herself with only Raija as he longtime companion So... getting her alone with just ppl she can trust is key. She prob will either be at events in the future, or maybe
23:22:51 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: at a bar or somewhere kinda private. And she will try her best to change the subject))
23:23:23 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: (cleon wont push and neither will atlaas but theyre very welcoming and probably good to trust)
23:23:48 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: (yeah they arent gonna press on it, just offer themselves should she want to talk)
23:23:57 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((okay, she figures as much - just with the rawness at hand, it will def be a few days))
23:24:05 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: She seemed so torn up about it... I can't help but wonder if it had anything to do with those bandages around her middle?
23:24:24 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...Actually. You know. They didn't look sanitary. And as a doctor, I can't let her walk around in scrappy bandages.
23:24:40 Adlanna-SistersofElune falls asleep, curled up next to her one true companion.
23:24:45 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Do you think I'd trouble her if I asked if she needed any medical attention?
23:25:18 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Mother... Sister... *she groans out in grief right before sleep takes her fully*
23:25:41 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I'd say asking is probably the best thing to do, she didn't seem like she wanted to bother us, but, perhaps if you offer medical care, she will accept it.
23:25:59 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I just want to make sure her wounds don't get infected. I'll knock again...
23:26:07 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Wait here, alright honey?
23:26:09 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Should I come as well, or..?
23:26:13 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Oh, yes.
23:26:20 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I'll be here then!
23:26:25 Cleon-CenarionCircle offers him a gentle kiss before floating out the door.
23:26:28 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Be good.
23:26:32 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Never!
23:26:43 Atlaas-CenarionCircle CHUCKLES
23:26:46 Cleon-CenarionCircle gives him a stern, yet soft look before leaving.
23:26:54 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Dunno what's gotten in to you.
23:27:06 Cleon-CenarionCircle turns to knock softly on Adlanna's door, not knowing she had fallen asleep.
23:27:45 Adlanna-SistersofElune stirs slightly, but remains sleeping - clutching onto Raija
23:28:20 Cleon-CenarionCircle knocks one more time, very softly. "Hey, Adlanna, mind if I check in on you about something?"
23:28:40 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: "The Light... Father... Mother... no... sister!" *she mutters as if in terror, still locked in a deep sleep*
23:28:54 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...
23:29:07 Cleon-CenarionCircle decides to enter, hearing her sleep talk and growing more concerned.
23:29:26 Cleon-CenarionCircle nudges her to try and wake her up. "You're having a nightmare."
23:29:54 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: "The... blue swirling... Father... why did... don't die again!" *still trapped in her sleepish toture*
23:30:13 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Ouuuh... What is it with elves and getting locked in to nightmares?
23:30:16 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: How do I... Mmmm...
23:30:46 Cleon-CenarionCircle attempts to use a ward to wake her up.
23:31:20 Adlanna-SistersofElune turns, almost coming out of it. Her eyes glow a bright blue hue*
23:31:37 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Ah-...! *Keeps trying*
23:31:49 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: "Why do... how do I... don't... AAAAAAAAARGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!"
23:31:56 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Eep-!
23:31:57 Atlaas-CenarionCircle h ears the commotion and rushes in.w
23:32:05 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Honey-...!
23:32:08 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Whats happening!
23:32:10 Adlanna-SistersofElune screams as she sits up quickly in a hard cold sweat
23:32:14 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Out! Out!
23:32:23 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Give the patient and her doctor some privacy!
23:32:29 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: She was screaming!
23:32:30 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Confidentiality is key!
23:32:37 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Scoot! Scoot
23:32:41 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: I was making sure shes _
23:32:48 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: aUgh
23:32:49 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Stay there.
23:32:55 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: no im going 
23:33:01 Cleon-CenarionCircle huffs through his nose.
23:33:03 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: A-alright...
23:33:06 Adlanna-SistersofElune pants, with her vision swimming in the tears still in her eyes as a dizziness sets in
23:33:07 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: You deal with that, im gettting us food, okay?
23:33:12 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Okay...
23:33:15 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Um!
23:33:19 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Pick me up some white wine.
23:33:20 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Love you.
23:33:22 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: if i leep hearing her scream i will.
23:33:26 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Not be happy
23:33:29 Cleon-CenarionCircle closes the door behind them.
23:33:36 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Sorry Adlanna.
23:33:48 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: W-where... w-what in the light of...
23:33:48 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I came in because you were having a nightmare. And also because I was concerned about your injury.
23:34:31 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks up at Cleon, her eyes still partially dialated "Is this... a-am I..."
23:34:51 Thomas Miller says: Fresh bread for sale!
23:35:19 Adlanna-SistersofElune holds her head with one hand, grimicing in nasusa "I d-don't know exactly what happened..."
23:35:49 Cleon-CenarionCircle furrows his brows in concern and places his medical bag on the bed at her feet.
23:36:07 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks over at her pet, who nudges her with a strange cautious air of concern to her
23:36:18 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: That's alright. You don't need to say anything to me if you don't want to. I just want to make sure your bandages are appropriate. They don't look good.
23:36:41 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I'm a trained medical professional. I can't just sit idly by while someone is injured and needs assistance.
23:36:46 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Please, accept it.
23:36:52 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks down at her waist and winces at the slight reddish hue still present in them
23:37:45 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I-I would accept kindly. I am sorry that I bothered you so with my... nightmare? *closes her eyes again as another waive of dizziness shows, abit less violent*
23:38:04 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: (goddamn you atlaas)
23:38:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((NOW I WILL KILL YOU, YOU FOOL))
23:38:36 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: ((okay, im good now))
23:39:28 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: No, no. You didn't bother me at all.
23:40:01 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Come closer, please. May I inspect what hides beneath the bandages?
23:40:52 Adlanna-SistersofElune | Shinigami (死神) yells: ((FOOLISH YOUNG MORTAL ATLAAS. YOU HAVE ANGERED THE RP GODS FOR THE LAST TIME))
23:41:08 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I... would appriciate that.
23:41:30 Adlanna-SistersofElune moves to the edge of the bed, closer to Cleon
23:42:35 Cleon-CenarionCircle unwraps her bandages carefully and puts them in a special bag with a 'biohazard' label on it.
23:42:42 Thomas Miller says: Freshly baked bread for sale!
23:42:47 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Hmm... *Inspects her injury now that it is bare*
23:43:28 Adlanna-SistersofElune looks down and winces as a slight infection appears to be present
23:43:47 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: (what is it, a cut? what kind of cut?)
23:44:13 Cleon-CenarionCircle puts on his reading glasses so he can better inspect her wound.
23:46:06 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Mmmm... Yeah, this isn't so good. It's very laiden with puss and the scabs appear to have formed against the bandage.
23:46:15 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Have you been changing bandages often?
23:46:47 Thomas Miller says: Freshly baked bread for sale!
23:47:10 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: U-um... *stares away with embarassment* Not quite as often as would be needed
23:47:34 Cleon-CenarionCircle nods understandingly. "That explains a lot. It's a good thing I checked up on you then."
23:47:45 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Just a moment. I'll make you a fresh set.
23:47:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Thank you...
23:48:45 Adlanna-SistersofElune furrows her eyebrows as bits and pieces of her dream come back to her "Uggh..."
23:49:10 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Alrighty then.
23:49:13 Adlanna-SistersofElune raises a hand to her sweaty temple as another wave of pain washes over her
23:49:44 Cleon-CenarionCircle finishes wrapping her in fresh bandages, and then hands her a set of more.
23:49:54 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Changing bandages every twelve hours is imperitive to a swift recovery.
23:50:10 Atlaas-CenarionCircle lies down before Innkeeper Allison.
23:50:21 Adlanna-SistersofElune carefully accepts the bandages, staring at her wound and traces around the bandages with her other
23:50:26 Atlaas-CenarionCircle lies down before Cleon-CenarionCircle.
23:50:45 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Now... I can't help but notice you are also very pale, and sweating. Your skin is not it's normal pink self.
23:51:16 Atlaas-CenarionCircle falls asleep. Zzzzzzz.
23:51:35 Atlaas-CenarionCircle falls asleep. Zzzzzzz.
23:51:37 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I haven't been ill except in more pain over my wound than usual...
23:51:44 Atlaas-CenarionCircle falls asleep. Zzzzzzz.
23:51:45 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Pain...
23:51:54 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: What kind of pain? You look like you're about to faint.
23:52:03 Human Commoner says: To Brewfest!
23:52:07 Cleon-CenarionCircle casts purify, just to be safe.
23:52:22 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I - erg - think that most of this is caused do to the dream I had... though why I do not know
23:52:31 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Uh
23:52:34 Milon-CenarionCircle roars with bestial vigor at Atlaas-CenarionCircle.  So fierce!
23:52:35 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Hi
23:52:42 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: N-...Now what.
23:52:44 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Hold just a moment.
23:52:51 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: ......
23:52:56 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: What happened?
23:52:58 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I heard a roar.
23:53:02 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: There was a large worgen man in my bed.
23:53:07 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Oh, well.
23:53:09 [Atlaas-CenarionCircle]: Then he evaporated.
23:53:14 Adlanna-SistersofElune hears the commotion and stands up unsteadly to follow down after Cleon "Raiji, stay here please."
23:53:14 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...Alrighty.
23:53:19 Atlaas-CenarionCircle falls asleep. Zzzzzzz.
23:53:26 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Worry not.
23:53:35 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Just a worgen who materialized in our bedroom.
23:53:38 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Nothing out of the ordinary.
23:53:42 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Please, sit back down.
23:53:50 Adlanna-SistersofElune stumbles slightly, then steady herself "Aah... I guess that is fine then."
23:54:20 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: So... more pain than usual.
23:54:31 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I don't know how a nightmare would be able to inflict physical pain.
23:55:59 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I am not sure either... But, the strange thing is that it felt more than just a nightmare... As if a piece of me was being touched by something far beyond my understanding. *As she talks a flicker of blue pulses in her amber eyes briefly before she shuts
23:55:59 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: her eyes* Ugh, another headache?
23:56:13 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: And headaches too...
23:56:43 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Do you suppose the blade that left you with such a wound had been laiden in poison?
23:56:48 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Not until recently. I thought it was just- *she pauses in mid-sentence*
23:57:20 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: It could be, but I have built up a resistance to most of them as part of my huntress training
23:57:33 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Resistant, but not immune.
23:57:45 Adlanna-SistersofElune crinkles her nose
23:58:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Perhaps, but... it does not feel the same way as a tug at one's mortal heartstrings normally feels
23:58:29 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: The pain feels... deeper
23:58:51 Cleon-CenarionCircle takes out his notepad and begins writing notes down about what she is describing.
23:58:52 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: But from what, I cannot say.
23:59:09 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I would have to know more to correctly diagnose you. 
23:59:16 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Hmm...
23:59:23 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I do not know if this could be a poison, or a curse.
23:59:28 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Or perhaps something else.
00:00:19 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Perhaps another day. My body simply feels tired and needing of rest. I do not feel like my inner winds are ebbing... Perhaps time would reveal more?
00:00:44 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I am sorry, I should show myself more greatful but... the only other time I have felt anything similar
00:01:21 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: If you insist. But I must remind you, within a doctor/patient relationship, anything you tell me shall remain confidential unless I believe you are about to hurt yourself or others. Even then, it would have to be dire.
00:01:31 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Is... well... *her voice drops quieter* the morning after my father put me to sleep for the last time.
00:01:40 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: ...Ah...
00:01:48 Cleon-CenarionCircle nods in some semblance of understanding.
00:01:50 Adlanna-SistersofElune nods her head at Cleon's words
00:02:03 Human Commoner says: Here's to the Alliance!
00:02:26 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: All I can gather is that you were attacked, and it is a great trauma on your mind.
00:02:27 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I do not know why I would feel so... So many wonders and worries have been plaguing my mind after what happened earlier this evening.
00:02:34 Thomas Miller says: Warm, wholesome bread!
00:03:06 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I do not know for sure if that is the case... Whatever I felt while in that... dream state? *another crinkle of her nose*
00:03:26 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: It felt old and ancient, but as if it had been there for a long time
00:04:01 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Almost... gentle yet overwelming.
00:04:14 Cleon-CenarionCircle listens to her as she tells him whatever information she will provide.
00:04:26 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: As if a hole was being pierced through me along with my... grief
00:04:46 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Letting something out for the first time, but only briefly before the hole being sealed again
00:05:10 Cleon-CenarionCircle has put his notepad down to merely listen with sympathy.
00:05:32 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Did someone hurt you tonight?
00:06:32 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: No... in fact, quite the opposite. A... truth was laid before me almost unbearable but was followed by remorse and kindness.
00:06:38 Thomas Miller says: Freshly baked bread for sale!
00:06:41 Adlanna-SistersofElune frowns again
00:06:55 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: I see.
00:07:03 Human Commoner says: To Brewfest!
00:07:08 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: Maybe... she would know more about it.
00:07:57 Adlanna-SistersofElune feels the pain finally fading into nothingness
00:08:05 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: For now... *he closes up his medical bag and carries it at his side* ...I do believe you've earned a good rest. I've cleaned up what I could on your wound, and remember to replace those bandages come morning.
00:08:19 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Monitor your headaches and dizzy spells closely.
00:08:25 Adlanna-SistersofElune takes his advice with seriousness
00:08:46 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: And remember, if you need anyone to talk to, we're only a few doors down. 
00:09:01 Cleon-CenarionCircle offers a gentle smile.
00:09:13 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I will remember... I thank you kindly
00:09:18 Cleon-CenarionCircle bows down graciously.
00:09:53 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Goodnight, Adlanna.
00:09:58 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I feel as if I could tell you more about what is running through my mind, but... I think that would best be for when my mental state is better settled on the truth.
00:10:24 Cleon-CenarionCircle nods. "Giving yourself time to process your emotions is very healthy."
00:10:35 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Sleep on it, my dear.
00:10:53 [Adlanna-SistersofElune]: I will... Until then, I thank you. If there is any changes, I will come to you at the first sign of anything out of the ordinary.
00:11:27 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Very good. My office, should you need it, is in New Tinkertown in Dun Morogh. My mom is very sick right now, so I will be tending to her, but I am never too busy for other patients.
00:11:38 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Or, again, if you'd like to visit as a friend, I'm around.
00:11:41 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Goodnight, Adlanna.
00:11:56 Cleon-CenarionCircle smiles and bows, floating off to rejoin his husband.
00:11:59 Cleon-CenarionCircle bows down graciously.
00:12:16 Atlaas-CenarionCircle is asleep.
00:12:16 [Cleon-CenarionCircle]: Hey, you.
