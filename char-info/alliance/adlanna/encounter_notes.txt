9/17 - Met Moria Fellgrave, who was looking for her brother Cleon. Later, while wandering after helping a small girl look for her balloons, Adlanna officially encountered the... interesting being known as Lucy. She continued to wander around with her tabby, before becoming a magician's "test subject". Still tending to the wounds she gained in Westfall, she decided to have a drink before heading off to rest some more.

10/1 - Helped Salma Saldean feed orphens. Adlanna was moved by the joy and tears the children showed.
